    "\n",
    "## The Challenge\n",
    "Recurring revenue businesses struggle with customer churn, impacting growth and profitability. With customer acquisition costs 5-25x higher than retention costs, companies face significant revenue loss when customers leave. The challenge is compounded by siloed data across systems - customer profiles in CRM, purchase history in ERP, and engagement metrics in web/mobile analytics platforms. Without a unified view, teams can't identify at-risk customers before they churn or understand the underlying causes driving customer departures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Solution\n",
    "Databricks enables cross-functional teams to build a complete Customer 360 view and deploy proactive churn reduction strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team leverages the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform to transform fragmented customer data into actionable insights:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/databricks-demos/dbdemos-resources/blob/main/images/cross_demo_assets/Lakehouse_Demo_Team_architecture.png?raw=true\" style=\"float: right; margin-right: 20px; width: 50%;\" alt=\"Team Workflow\"/>\n",
    "1. **Data Unification**: `John`, our Data Engineer, builds Delta Live Tables pipelines to synchronize and transform data from disparate sources (CRM, ERP, web analytics, mobile app) into a unified Customer 360 database. This creates a single source of truth with real-time data ingestion capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Governance & Security**: `Emily` implements Unity Catalog to ensure proper data governance, providing role-based access controls while maintaining data lineage and compliance. This enables secure collaboration across business units while protecting sensitive customer information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced Analytics**: `Alice`, our BI Analyst, uses SQL Analytics to identify churn patterns, segment customers by risk level, and quantify the financial impact of retention improvements. These insights drive strategic decision-making across the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Predictive Intelligence**: `Marc` applies AutoML to develop custom machine learning models that predict which customers are likely to churn and identify the key factors contributing to churn risk. These models continuously improve as new data becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **AI-Powered Intervention**: `Liza` leverages Mosaic AI to transform predictive insights into preventative actions. Using generative AI, she creates personalized retention campaigns, tailored offers, and proactive customer service interventions that address specific churn risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By connecting these capabilities in a seamless workflow, the team not only predicts which customers might leave but also understands why they're at risk and automatically triggers the most effective retention strategies for each customer segment.\n",
