    "AI/BI Genie is a no-code interface powered by AI with data intelligence that allows business users to conduct self-serve data analytics using natural language. Domain experts, such as data analysts, configure Genie spaces with datasets, sample queries, and text guidelines to help Genie translate business questions into analytical queries. After set up, business users can ask questions and generate visualizations to understand operational data. You can continuously update Genie’s semantic knowledge as your data changes and users pose new questions."

    "## Part 4: Best Practices and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start small\n",
    "  * Curating a Genie space is an iterative process. When creating a new space, start as small as possible, with minimal instructions and a limited set of questions to answer. Then, you can add as you iterate based on feedback and monitoring. This approach helps streamline creating and maintaining your space and allows you to curate it effectively in response to real user needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use the following guidelines to help create a small Genie space:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Stay focused: Include only the tables necessary to answer the questions you want the space to handle. Aim for five or fewer tables. The more focused your selection, the better. Keeping your space narrowly focused on a small amount of data is ideal, so limit the number of columns in your included tables.\n",
    "    * Plan to iterate: Start with a minimal setup for your space, focusing on essential tables and basic instructions. Add more detailed guidance and examples as you refine the space over time, rather than aiming for perfection initially.\n",
    "    * Build on well-annotated tables: Genie uses Unity Catalog column names and descriptions to generate responses. Clear column names and descriptions help produce high-quality responses. Column descriptions should offer precise contextual information. Avoid ambiguous or unnecessary details. Inspect any AI-generated descriptions for accuracy and clarity, and only use them if they align with what you would manually provide.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Have a domain expert define the space\n",
    "  * An effective space creator needs to understand the data and the insights that can be gleaned from it. Data analysts who are proficient in SQL typically have the knowledge and skills to curate the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define the purpose of your space\n",
    "  * Identifying your space’s specific audience and purpose helps you decide which data, instructions, and test questions to use. A space should answer questions for a particular topic and audience, not general questions across various domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test and adjust\n",
    "  * You should be your space’s first user. After you create a new space, start asking questions. Carefully examine the SQL generated in response to your questions. If Genie misinterprets the data, questions, or business jargon, you can intervene by editing the generated SQL or providing other specific instructions. Keep testing and editing until you’re getting reliable responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * After you’ve reviewed a question, you can add it as a benchmark question that you can use to systematically test and score your space for overall accuracy. You can use variations and different questions phrasings to test Genie’s responses. See Use benchmarks in a Genie space.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * See Troubleshooting for ideas on fixing erroneous responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conduct user testing\n",
    "  * After verifying response quality through testing, recruit a business user to try the Genie space. Use the following guidelines to provide a smooth user journey and collect feedback for ongoing improvement:\n",
    "    * Set expectations that their job is to help to refine the room.\n",
    "    * Ask them to focus their testing on the specific topic and questions the space is designed to answer.\n",
    "    * If they receive an incorrect response, encourage users to add additional instructions and clarifications in the chat to refine the answer. When a correct response is provided, they should upvote the final query to minimize similar errors in future interactions.\n",
    "    * Tell users to upvote or downvote responses using the built-in feedback mechanism.\n",
    "    * Invite users to share additional feedback and unresolved questions directly with the space authors. Authors and editors can use feedback to refine instructions, examples, and trusted assets.\n",
    "  * Consider providing training materials or a written document with guidelines for testing the room and providing feedback. As business users test the space, you’ll see the questions they’ve asked on the History tab. Continue adding instructions to help Genie correctly interpret the questions and data to provide accurate answers. See Review history and feedback to learn more about how to monitor Genie spaces."
